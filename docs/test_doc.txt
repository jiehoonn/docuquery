The Solar System consists of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The Sun contains 99.86% 
of the mass of the entire Solar System. There are eight recognized planets in the Solar System. 
In order from the Sun, they are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System. It has a mass of approximately 1.898 × 10^27 kg, 
which is more than twice the mass of all other planets combined. Jupiter has at least 95 known moons. 
The four largest moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto — are called the Galilean moons because 
they were first observed by Galileo Galilei in 1610.

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is often called the "Red Planet" because iron oxide on 
its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars has two small moons: Phobos and Deimos. The highest 
mountain in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars, standing at approximately 21.9 km tall. 
Mars has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide (95.3%).

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is famous for its prominent ring system. Saturn has 
146 known moons, with Titan being the largest. Titan is the only moon in the Solar System with 
a dense atmosphere. Saturn's density is so low that it would float if placed in water.
